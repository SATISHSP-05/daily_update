1. What are Higher order functions?
   Higher order functions is the function that take another function as an argumnet  either  return a function as its result.
It used to make code reusable and cleaner to handle asynchronous operations easily like callback promises.

types of higher order function are
  map(),reduce(),filter(),foreach()

map() is a method used with array to create a new array by performing specific opareation on the each element of original array
    
      let number=[1,2,3,4,5,]
      let result= number.map(num=>num*2)
      console.log(result);  

foreach() is a method is used to loop through the each element of an array and run the function on every element and 
avoid use of for loop.

     const number=[1,2,3,4,5]
     number.forEach(function(num){
     console.log("num",num);

filter() is a method used with array  to create a new array containig only the that test pass elements  provided by the function

     const number=[1,2,3,4,5]
let result = number.filter(num => num>3)
       console.log(result)

reduce() is method is used to reduse all the array elements into a single value 

     const number=[1,2,3,4,5]
       const total =number.reduce((acc,curr)=> acc+curr,0)
          console.log(total);



2.  What is the prototype? 
        The prototype is an object that is associated with every function and object in JavaScript. 
prototype in javaScript each object has a prototype which serves the template for creating a new object.
It is used to add properties and methods to objects, and it is also used in 
prototype chaining. 


prototype chaining  i sthe process of travaersing the prototype chain to access the propertice anad method of an objects
 prototype and its parent prototype

Prototype Inheritance is mechanism where one object can access properties and methods of another object using the prototype chain.

__proto__ is used with object  instanse means referse to its parant prototype

Function Prototype is an automatically created object property available only on functions.
It contains an object that becomes the prototype of all instances created using the new keyword.


example :-
const grandParent = { a: 1 };        
const parent = Object.create(grandParent); 
const child = Object.create(parent);      

console.log(child.a);  



example:-

function Animal() {}
Animal.prototype.eat = function () {
  return "Eating...";
};
function Dog() {}
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
const d = new Dog();
console.log(d.eat()); 


3. this keyword 

this keyword js refer to object the object that is executing the current function .the value of the this determained by how a function os called.

Global Context  :- When this is used outside any function or inside a function , it refers to the global object.  

function Context :- when a regular function is called without any object, this automatically refers to the global object

Arrow Functions :Arrow functions do not create their own this. They take this from the surrounding (lexical) scope.

this in Constructor Function :- In constructor functions or ES6 classes, this refers to the newly created object.

Method Context :-When a function is called as a method of an object, this refers to that object.

Explicit Binding (call, apply, bind)

.call() → pass arguments one by one

.apply() → pass arguments in array

.bind() → returns new function with fixed this


example:-
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello " + this.name);
}

const user = { name: "Satish" };

greet.call(user); 



example:-
 const user = {
  name: "Satish",
  getName() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};
user.getName(); 


example:-
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

const p = new Person("Satish");
console.log(p.name); 




                                                                  END
