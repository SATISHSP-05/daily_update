1.arrow function

arrow function is a consis and cleaner way to write functions in JavaScript.
it was introduced in ES6 and is often used because of its simple syntax and the way it handles the this keyword.
Arrow functions do not have their own this, arguments, super, or new.target.
Instead, they inherit this from the surrounding (lexical) scope, which is one of the biggest differences from normal functions.

examples

const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const doubled = nums.map(n => n * 2);
console.log(doubled); 



const sayHello = () => console.log("Hello!");
sayHello();


const add = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(add(5, 3));


const numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20];
const result = numbers.filter(n => n > 10);
console.log(result); 



3.callback
A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.
It allows one function to run after another function has finished its execution.

example:

function greet(name, callback) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
  callback();
}

function sayBye() {
  console.log("Goodbye!");
}

greet("Satish", sayBye);


console.log ("callback")
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("This runs after 2 seconds");
}, 2000);



4.Callback Hell
Callback Hell is a situation in JavaScript where too many nested callbacks make the code look messy,
hard to read, and difficult to maintain. 
This usually happens in asynchronous operations when callbacks are written inside other callbacks.

 example :
 setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("first prints");
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("secand prints");
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("third prints");
    }, 1000);
  }, 2000);
}, 3000);


5. explain  ES6 [ECMAScript]
ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) is a major update to JavaScript that introduced modern syntax and
 features to make the language more powerful,cleaner, and easier to write.
It added improvements like let/const, arrow functions, classes, promises, modules, and many more.

Features:
5.1 let and const (Block-scoped variables)
let → can be updated
const → cannot be reassigned
Both are block scoped, unlike var.




6. explain Promise
A Promise is an object in JavaScript that represents the result of an asynchronous operation.
It has three states:
Pending – operation is in progress
resolve – operation completed successfully
Rejected – operation failed
A promise allows you to run code after an async task finishes using then(), catch(), and finally().

example:
function promise() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const success = true;

      if (success) {
        resolve("Data fetched successfully!");
      } else {
        reject("Error fetching data");
      }
    }, 1000);
  });
}

promise()
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(error => console.log(error));


7. What is async/await 
async/await is a cleaner and more readable way to work with Promises.
async → makes a function return a Promise
await → pauses the code until the Promise resolves
It makes asynchronous code look like synchronous code.

example:
function async() {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("Data fetched successfully!");
    }, 2000);
  });
}
async function showData() {
  console.log("hello.");
  const result = await fetchData(); 
  console.log(result);
}
showData();
