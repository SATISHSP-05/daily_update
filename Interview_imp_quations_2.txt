1.What is closure and Advantages and disadvantages?
   
A closure is a function that has access to its own scope, the outer function's scope, and the global scope.
even after the outer function has finished  executing . Closures are useful for maintaining state in an application,
 creating private variables, and implementing data encapsulation.


Advantages:
Allows private variables :– Data inside closure cannot be accessed directly from outside.
Remembers data even after outer function ends :– Inner function keeps the variables alive.
Reduces global variables :– Helps avoid polluting the global scope.

Disadvantages:
Higher memory usage :– Variables stay in memory as long as closure exists.
Difficult for beginners to understand :– Concept of remembering old values can be confusing.
Possible memory leaks :– If closures are not handled properly, memory gets wasted.
Harder to debug :– Hidden variables inside closures make debugging tricky.

example 1 :

function cartcounter(){
    let count=0;
    return function(){
        count++;
        return`item added ${count}`
    }
};

let add_count=cartcounter();
console.log(add_count());
console.log(add_count());


example 2 :

function greet(message) {
  return function (name) {
    return message + ", " + name;
  };
}

const hello = greet("Hello");
console.log(hello("Satish"));
console.log(hello("sp"));


2. promises
 Promises are objects representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. 
They are used  then amd catch to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript, 

resolve is value called when theh operation succeds
reject is error colled when the operation fails

              -:promise state:-
pending : initial state means async operaion still running
fullfill : success state means operation success
reject : means operaion state

             -:promises chaining:- 
you can chain multiple .then() blocks .each one runs after the previous finish
catch(): handles the error when happens catch it 

     -:promise method (static method):-

promises.all() :- wait for all promise to resolve or reject if any one failed.
promise.race():- resolve / rejct as son as its defined
promise.allsettled() :- wait for all to fully reject or fully resolve.
promise.any() :- resolve  as soon as one promise resolve


let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject)=>{
    let success= true;
    if(success){
        resolve("resolve")
    }
    else
    {
        reject("reject")
    }
    
});
promise 
.then((message)=>console.log(message))
.catch((error)=>console.log(error));


async function demo() {
  let first = await new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("First done"), 2000);
  });

  console.log(first);

  let second = await new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Second done"), 1500);
  });

  console.log(second);
}

demo();




3.cookies, sessions and local storages?

-:Cookies:- 
Cookies are small pieces of data stored in the browser.
They are sent automatically to the server with every request.
Used mainly for authentication, sessions, and tracking.
it stores data arround 4KB .
Can be set with an expiry time.
Good for storing login tokens and user session IDs.

 -:Local Storage:-
Local Storage is a browser-based storage that stores data permanently.
Data does not go to the server, only stored on the client.
Has a large storage limit 5–10MB.
Data stays even after closing and reopening the browser.
Used for saving user preferences, dark mode, cart items, etc.
Best for storing non-sensitive, long-term data.

-:Session Storage:-

Session Storage is similar to Local Storage but lives only for one tab.
Data is deleted when the tab is closed.
Has a similar limit 5MB.
Not shared between tabs.
Used for temporary data, like form steps, OTP flow, or page progress.
