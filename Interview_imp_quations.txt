1. Explain var, let, and const differences.
      ->  like var is container used to store the data value such are number ,text is a given to a memory location whre data is stored.
   there are 3 types mainly
   var
   let
   const
 var : is the oldest way to declare the variable var is the function scope and can be redeclared and reassigned
 function scope : available  inside the whole function not just inside block

 let : let is introduced in Es6 , let is the block-scope it can be reassigned but not redeclared

 const : let is introduced in Es6 , const is the block-scope it can not reassigned and redeclared.
 
 ->var example
    var name = "Satish";
   console.log(name);

   function test() {
   var x = 10;
   console.log(x);
}
test();

-> let example
      let age = 20;
    console.log(age); 

     age = 21; 
    console.log(age); 

->  const example
    const pi = 3.14;
    console.log(pi);

2.  What is hoisting?
    hosting is the machanism where variable and fucntion declaration move on the top of their scope during compilation before executing 
    in variable , var is hoisted  the default value is undefined and we can access it before the declaration 
     let is also hoisted  the default value is uninitialized its TDZ and access before declaration not allowed 
     const is also hoisted  the default value is uninitialized its TDZ and access before declaration not allowed 
     
     TDZ : means the time between the hoisting and the actual initialization 
    
     function declaraion is the hoisted default value shows is access before declaration 
     function expression  is partially hoisted the default vaue is undefined access before declation it shows type error
     arror function is also partially hoisted defaukt value uninitialized and access before declaration refference error

   example var 
         console.log(a);   
         var a = 10;
         console.log("After:", a);
 
   example let 
        console.log(b); 
        let b = 20;

   example const 
       console.log(c); 
       const c = 30;

   example function declaraion 
        greet(); 
        function greet() {
        console.log("Hello from function declaration!");
                          }

   example of function expression 
          
        sum();
      var sum = function() {
      console.log("Function Expression");
            };
    
     example of the arrow funtion
          add(); 
          let add = () => {
          console.log("Arrow Function");
                };

3.  Difference between == and ===.
     == is loose equality operatore it compare two values for equality but ignore the data types 
   === is strict equality operatore it compare both vaues and data types 

            example ==
        console.log(5 == "5");  true

            example ===    
        console.log(5 === "5");  false 

4.  Explain the difference between primitive and non-primitive data types.
      primitive datatype :- it is basic building block it hold the single value at a time ,the values stores directly in thr memory , 
      and it is immutable means the value can not change directly 
       types of primitives are numbers,strings,boolean ,null 
      
      non primitive is also colled reference type that can hold the multiple valuse at a time ,values can not store directly in memory
      and it is mutable means the value can not change value
       types array function object 

      example Primitive
 
      let num1 = 10;
      let num2 = num1;
      num2 = 20;

      let str1 = "Hello";
      let str2 = str1;
      str2 = "World";

      let bool1 = true;
      let bool2 = bool1;
      bool2 = false;

      let n1 = null;
      let n2 = n1;

      example Non-Primitive

      let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
      let arr2 = arr1;
      arr2.push(4);

      let obj1 = { name: "Satish", age: 22 };
      let obj2 = obj1;
      obj2.age = 23;

      let fun1 = function () { return 100; };
      let fun2 = fun1;

5. Explain the this keyword.
      This keyword in JavaScript refers to the object that is executing the current function.
 The value of this is determined by how a function is called.

     async function greet() {
     return "Hello!";
     }

     greet().then(msg => console.log(msg));


     async function wait() {
       console.log("Wait");
       let result = await new Promise(resolve =>
         setTimeout(() => resolve(" Done"), 2000)
       );
       console.log(result);
     }

     wait();


     let myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
       let success = true;
     
       if (success) {
         resolve("Operation successful ");
       } else {
         reject("Something went wrong ");
       }
     });

     myPromise     
     .then(res => console.log(res))
     .catch(err => console.log(err));

6.  Explain closures? What are its advantages?
      A closure is a function that has access to its own scope, the outer function's scope, and the global scope.
Closures are useful for maintaining state in an application, creating private variables, and implementing data encapsulation.


       example closure


       function counter(){
         let count = 0; 
         return function () {   
           count++;
           console.log(count);
         };
       }

       let increment = counter();
       increment(); 
       increment(); 
       increment(); 


       example 2
   
       function greet(name) {        
         return function () {       
           console.log("Hello, " + name);
         };
       }

       let sayHi = greet("Satish");

       sayHi(); 


7.  What is an IIFE?
      IIFE stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expression.
      It is a JavaScript function that is executed as soon as it is defined. 
      It is typically used to create a new scope to avoid polluting the global namespace.

        (function () {
        console.log("IIFE executed immediately!");
        })();


      (function (name) {
      console.log("Hello, " + name);
       })("Satish");


8. What are Higher order functions?
      Higher order functions are functions that operate on other functions by taking them as arguments or returning them. 
They enable functional programming concepts like composition, currying, and lazy evaluation.
  types of higher order function are
  map(),reduce(),filter(),foreach()

map() is a method used with array to create a new array by performing specific opareation on the each element of original array
    
      let number=[1,2,3,4,5,]
      let result= number.map(num=>num*2)
      console.log(result);  

foreach() is a method is used to loop through the each element of an array and run the function on every element and 
avoid use of for loop.

     const number=[1,2,3,4,5]
     number.forEach(function(num){
     console.log("num",num);

filter() is a method used with array  to create a new array containig only the that test pass elements  provided by the function

     const number=[1,2,3,4,5]
let result = number.filter(num => num>3)
       console.log(result)

reduce() is method is used to reduse all the array elements into a single value 

     const number=[1,2,3,4,5]
       const total =number.reduce((acc,curr)=> acc+curr,0)
          console.log(total);



9. What is prototype chaining?
    Prototype chaining is the mechanism in JavaScript where an object inherits properties and methods from its prototype object, 
which in turn can inherit from another prototype object. This creates a chain of prototypes, allowing for hierarchical inheritance.   
       const person = {
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello, I am a person.");
  }
};
const student = {
  study() {
    console.log("I am studying.");
  }
};
Object.setPrototypeOf(student, person); 
student.study();  
student.greet();

10.  What is the prototype? 
     The prototype is an object that is associated with every function and object in JavaScript. 
It is used to add properties and methods to objects, and it is also used in prototype chaining.
    
 function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;     
  this.age = age;        
}
Person.prototype.introduce = function () {
  console.log("Hi, I am " + this.name + " and I am " + this.age + " years old.");
};
const p1 = new Person("Satish", 25);
const p2 = new Person("Kumar", 30);
p1.introduce(); 
p2.introduce();
