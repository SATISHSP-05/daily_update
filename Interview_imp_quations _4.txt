Higher-order function
 function takes another function as an argument OR It returns another function as a result.


-:function as an argument:-

function applyDiscount(price, discountFunction) {
  return discountFunction(price);
}

function festivalDiscount(price) {
  return price * 0.80; 
}

function couponDiscount(price) {
  return price - 100; 
}

console.log(applyDiscount(1000, festivalDiscount)); 
console.log(applyDiscount(1000, couponDiscount));   



-:returns another function:-

function taxCalculator(gstRate) {
  return function (amount) {
    return amount + (amount * gstRate);
  };
}

const electronicsGST = taxCalculator(0.18);
const clothingGST = taxCalculator(0.05);

console.log(electronicsGST(2000)); 
console.log(clothingGST(2000));    





-:filter industrial level example:-
const products = [
  { name: "Shoes", price: 1500 },
  { name: "T-Shirt", price: 700 },
  { name: "Watch", price: 900 }
];

const under1000 = products.filter(p => p.price < 1000);

console.log(under1000);



 types of higher order function are
  map(),reduce(),filter(),foreach()

map() is a method used with array to create a new array by performing specific opareation on the each element of original array
    
      let number=[1,2,3,4,5,]
      let result= number.map(num=>num*2)
      console.log(result);  

foreach() is a method is used to loop through the each element of an array and run the function on every element and 
avoid use of for loop.

 const number = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
 number.forEach(function(num) {
  console.log("num:", num);
});


filter() is a method used with array  to create a new array containig only the that test pass elements  provided by the function

     const number=[1,2,3,4,5]
let result = number.filter(num => num>3)
       console.log(result)

reduce() is method is used to reduse all the array elements into a single value 

     const number=[1,2,3,4,5]
       const total =number.reduce((acc,curr)=> acc+curr,0)
          console.log(total);


join commands 

a join in sql is used to combine the row from two or more tables based on a related column between them

types of joins are 

inner join :-Returns only the rows that match in both tables.
If there is no match, the row is not included in the final result.
example :-


SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, o.item, o.amount
FROM Customers c
INNER JOIN Orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;



full outer join :- FULL JOIN returns all rows from both tables, whether they match or not.
Matched rows are combined; non-matching rows are filled with NULL on the side where no match exists.

SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, o.item
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id

UNION

SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, o.item
FROM Customers c
RIGHT JOIN Orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;


left join :- returns all rows from the left table, along with only the matching rows from the  right table.
If the right table has no corresponding match, SQL fills the left columns with NULL.

SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, o.item, o.amount
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;


right join :- returns all rows from the right table, along with only the matching rows from the left table.
If the left table has no corresponding match, SQL fills the left columns with NULL.

SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, o.item, o.amount
FROM Customers c
RIGHT JOIN Orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;


cross join :- CROSS JOIN creates a Cartesian product, meaning every row in the first table is paired with every row in the second table.
No relationship or condition is required.

SELECT c.first_name, o.item
FROM Customers c
CROSS JOIN Orders o;



self join :- SELF JOIN is when a table is joined with itself using an alias .
It is used when table rows have a relationship with other rows in the same table—like employees with managers. 


SELECT A.first_name AS person1, B.first_name AS person2, A.country
FROM Customers A
JOIN Customers B
ON A.country = B.country
AND A.customer_id <> B.customer_id;





aggregate functions 

aggregate function perform calculations on the group of row and return a single value as the result
they are commonly used with group by


 type of aggregatores are 

count () :-returns the numbers of rows that match a condition 
example:- 
SELECT Continent, COUNT(Name) AS TotalCountries
FROM country
GROUP BY Continent;


avg() :- return the avrage value of a numearic column
example:- 
SELECT Continent, AVG(LifeExpectancy) AS AvgLifeExpectancy
FROM country
GROUP BY Continent;

sum() :- return the total sum of  numeric column
example:-
SELECT Region, SUM(Population) AS TotalPopulation
FROM country
GROUP BY Region;

min() :- return the smallest value in the column 
example:-
SELECT Continent, MIN(GNP) AS MinGNP
FROM country
GROUP BY Continent;

max() :- return the largest value in the column     
example:-
SELECT Continent, MAX(Population) AS MaxPopulation
FROM country
GROUP BY Continent;




data controll commands 

grant :- is used to give or assing specific permisson to users  on the data base objects
 the main purpose is to allow the users to perfom the action like slect, insert, update and  delete  etc...




syntax is 
 grant permission _type 
on table_ name
to user_name



revoke :-   is used to remove previosly granted permission from user 

syntax is 
 revoke permission _type 
on table_ name
to user_name
